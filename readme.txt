This project is a online chatbot that accepts questions from users about my high school using the natural language. Sample questions are like "Who's your principle?" "how can I get to your dorm?" "Then what about the cafeteria?" Then, the bot will give an answer based on its database. We utilize the APIs product offered by Microsoft to extract and structalize information, and then 1) query answers from database or 2) find a sentence from all articles crawled from the school website by calculating the sentence relavance. I make this bot with a friend for a competition called Microsoft Beauty of Programming held in China. It's open to all the Chinese universities, and we made it to the final, but didn't get the top prize eventually.

This is a older version of the code (because the cloud server was deleted by my friend. Meanwhile the PC I stored the code, which belongs to my high school, was taken away by the school. Sad story.) The codes aren't sorted, and there are lots of garbages inside, so I am sorried about that.
